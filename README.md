# The 3d printer
This is just my CoreXY 3d printer that I want to print the frame for, and am trying to make the printer as cheap as possible.
The printer should end up being less than 150 dollars, but I also hope to make a filament extrusion system, and it also function as a laser cutter if needed. 
## CAD
This is the link for Onshape cad. https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d1304014e73009d6c11ef726/w/34172c7cf5d371a968e193e7/e/cf54ac2cfe94093a287dfb58
The CAD for this is in a step file, but does not have the belts, but they should go around the stepper botors, and attatach to the print head though the holes.
